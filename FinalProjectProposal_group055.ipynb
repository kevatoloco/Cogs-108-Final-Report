    "We hypothesize that alcohol consumption will be markedly low in the United States relative to other countries due to the older drinking age. Furthermore, in some other cultures, drinking is heavily ingrained in societal norms and also in religion, so alcohol consumption, regardless of age, is more acceptable in multiple contexts, not just in leisure. Additionally, we hypothesize that countries with higher alcohol consumption will also have an increased rate of alcohol-related accidents, since alcohol impairs important areas of functioning."

    "In the initial stages of completing our project, our group did extensive research on what kinds of data were available to us. All of the datasets that we've used in this project was found online and were given proper reference to it by linking them in the datasets section above. Although these datasets were published online and did not require us to sign any agreements, we were still concerned about the fact that we did not obtain the data ourselves and therefore don't know how the data was collected. This raised several more concerns about how accurate or reliable this data was, and had us wondering if it correctly represented the given populations. However, since we obtained our data from a research article (ourworldindata.org), Kaggle, and data.world (both of which were listed in the suggested resource list on the project guideline), we agreed that our datasets were reliable and valid enough for the scope of our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the topic of our project, our group discussed how misinformation could affect our analysis. Our datasets involve the reports of alcohol consumption, health related issues, and death rates, all of which are sensitive topics. Misinformation on this data could result from citizens who do not have access to health care, in which case those people may not be accounted for. In another case, it may be that developing countries do not have a reliable healthcare system that keeps all records of their patients. Another way data can be biased is if people do not accurately report their cases. For example, if a survey was sent out asking people to answer questions on their alcohol consumption behaviors, and even asking them to report what age they are and what age they started drinking, certain groups of people may be more inclined to lie in the survey about their drinking habits. To be more specific, underaged drinkers may lie about their ages. This relates back to what our group discussed about not knowing how our data was originally collected, whether it was through surveys or through hospital records. In either case, such misinformation could bias our data to skew our results."
